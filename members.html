          <h5>LEVERAGE THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO COMPLETE AGAINST LARGE SUPERMARKETS</h5>
          <p>
            Taken collectively, independent grocery store rank as the sixth-largest chain in the United States. As an
            independent grocery, you belong to a group that annually serves 70+ million consumers and accounts for over
            $75 billion in gross sales. The Grocer Exchange puts the power of those numbers to work for its member
            stores.
          </p>
          <p>
            The multicultured consumer base, primarily served by independents, is the fastest-growing segment in U.S.
            Grocery market, and consumer packaged goods manufracturers are consistently challenged to reach it
            effectively, reliably and consistently. CPG companies don't deal directly with individual stores or small
            groups.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Grcoer Exchange, however, represents our member, and implement the system required to qualify their
            store, coordinate large nation programs all the way down to the local level, and aquire, normalize, and

          </p>
          <h5>LEVELING THE FIELD</h5>

            the best interests of both independent grocers and manufacturers.

          <h5>THE POWER OF TECHNOLOGY TO OPTIMIZE YOUR STORES
          </h5>
          <p>
            By virtue of their size, big supermarket chains have massive amounts of technology available to run the
            opreations. Independent grocery store owners must know how your customers shop and control your store's
            inventory to fulfill the products people buy on any given day, week or month.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's no longer enpugh to simply walk the store looking at the shelves to place your order for more
            inventory.
            You need the technology tools that will help optimize your inventory based on past buying trends,
            product
            sales and seasonality - and even the weather! A proactive, automated inventory solution assures that
            you
            aren't running out of products people need and leaving money on the table.
          </p>
          <p>Redusing your load of slow or stagment products frees up expansive shelf space for more profitable
            items. One of newest Grocer Exchange member stores found that they had 30% of their invontrey producing
            zero
            revenue that had not solid for 12 month, and they discovered this in the first three month of being a
            member.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Grocer Exchange Loyalty program provides independent grocery store poerators with effective tool
            for
            incentivizing consumer and reward loyalty. The Grocer Exchange handles all the techical details of
            issuing
            virtual loyalty cards, wallets, and maintaining membership records.
          </p>
          <h5>TURNKEY LOYALTY PROGRAM</h5>
          <p>
            Independent supermarkets have generally operated at disadvantage to large chains: they don't have the
            resources needed to maintain a loyalty system or the technical requirments to oprate the program.
          </p>
          <p>
            Couple this aggressive invontry managment with real-time cash register transaction that includes sales
            history, invontry, order history and product. You suddenly have information you need torun your stor at
            optimal level. This is technology that only the big chain have had the luxury to be able to afford,
            until
            now!
          </p>
          <p>Furthermore, we use the collective muscle of our membership base to negotiate the best possible
            promotional deals with maufacturers -- Deals that no individual stor or store group could possibly
            achieve
            along.

              <p>
                The rising cost of energy has been a point of pain for grocers through the country. As one of the
                largest
                expenses that a grocer incurs on a regular basis, the Grocer Exchange team focused on how to
                dramatically
                reduce these cost. We have negotiated aggressive energy discount from an A+ rated power genrator to
                creat a
                program designed specifically. As a Basic Level member, you will gain access to insider pricing that
                will
                immediately reduce overall energy cost by making you apart of an energy-buying collective of our
